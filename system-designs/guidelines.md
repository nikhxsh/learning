# Enterprise System Design Considerations

## 1. Modularity

### Separation of Concerns
- Each component should encapsulate a single responsibility (SRP from SOLID).
- Use layered architecture (e.g., controller → service → repository).
- Avoid mixing business logic with presentation or persistence logic.

### Reusable and Independent Components
- Design components/services to be stateless where possible.
- Use interface-driven contracts (e.g., C# interfaces, REST APIs).
- Deploy modules independently using microservices or modular monoliths.
- Example: Authentication module reusable across multiple services.

## 2. Scalability

### Vertical and Horizontal Scaling
- **Vertical**: Scale up by increasing CPU/RAM (e.g., upgrade EC2 instance).
- **Horizontal**: Scale out by adding more nodes/containers.
  - Must use stateless design and session offloading (e.g., Redis, JWT).

### Load Balancing and Stateless Services
- Use application-layer (L7) load balancers for HTTP routing (e.g., AWS ALB).
- Keep service state in external storage (DB, cache, session store).
- Implement rate limiting and circuit breakers for graceful degradation.

## 3. Maintainability

### Clean Code and SOLID Principles
- Follow naming conventions, keep functions <50 lines, files <500 lines.
- Apply SOLID: 
  - **S**: SRP
  - **O**: Open-Closed (e.g., plugin systems)
  - **L**: Liskov Substitution
  - **I**: Interface Segregation
  - **D**: Dependency Injection (use DI containers like Autofac in .NET)

### Modular Design and Good Documentation
- Use domain-driven design (DDD) for module boundaries.
- Document APIs using Swagger/OpenAPI.
- Maintain ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) per component.

## 4. Security

### Authentication and Authorization
- Use industry standards (OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect, JWT).
- RBAC (Role-based) or ABAC (Attribute-based) policies.
- Rotate secrets using Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

### Encryption and Input Validation
- TLS (HTTPS) for all communications.
- AES-256 for data at rest; SHA-256 for hashing.
- Sanitize input to avoid injection (e.g., SQL, XSS).

## 5. Performance

### Fast Response Times
- Define SLOs (e.g., 95% of requests <200ms).
- Minimize N+1 queries with ORM tuning or manual joins.
- Parallelize I/O-bound operations using `async`/`await`.

### Efficient Algorithms and Caching
- Prefer O(log n) or O(1) operations where feasible.
- Use Redis/Memcached for hot-path caching (read-heavy).
- Implement client-side caching with ETags and Cache-Control headers.

## 6. Reliability & Availability

### Redundancy, Failover Strategies
- Multi-AZ deployments, cross-region replication.
- Active-active or active-passive failover strategies.
- Use retry with backoff, circuit breakers (Polly in C#).

### Health Checks and Resilience Patterns
- Use `/health` and `/ready` endpoints.
- Implement timeouts, fallbacks, bulkheads (via Hystrix/Polly).

## 7. Interoperability

### API-based Communication (REST, GraphQL)
- REST for CRUD-heavy, GraphQL for flexible queries.
- Use OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas for validation and contracts.

### Standard Protocols and Data Formats
- JSON for APIs, Avro/Protobuf for internal RPC.
- Use HTTP/2 or gRPC for high-performance inter-service comms.

## 8. Portability & Deployment

### Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Dockerize apps with slim images (e.g., `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0`).
- Use Helm charts or Kustomize for k8s configuration.
- Design for cloud-neutral deployment with 12-factor app principles.

### CI/CD and Infrastructure as Code
- GitHub Actions/GitLab for CI, ArgoCD or Flux for GitOps.
- Use Terraform/Pulumi for infrastructure provisioning.
- Define pipelines with test, build, security scan, deploy stages.

## 9. Testability

### Automated Unit/Integration Testing
- High unit test coverage (>80%) using xUnit/NUnit.
- Integration tests with in-memory DBs or Docker Compose environments.

### Mocking and Test Environments
- Use mocking libraries (e.g., Moq in C#).
- Canary environments for safe real-user testing.
- Contract testing with tools like Pact for API dependencies.

## 10. Observability

### Logging, Monitoring, Tracing
- Structured logs (JSON) shipped to ELK/CloudWatch.
- Use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.
- Add correlation IDs to all requests across services.

### Metrics and Alerting Systems
- Expose Prometheus metrics (`/metrics` endpoint).
- Use Grafana dashboards.
- Set alerts for error rates, latency, CPU/memory, queue depth.

## RPO, RTO, SLA — Disaster Recovery Metrics

### RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
- Maximum acceptable data loss duration.
- If RPO = 10 minutes, backup must occur at least every 10 min.
- **Formula**:  
  `RPO = Current Time - Last Valid Backup Time`

### RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
- Maximum acceptable downtime after a disaster.
- RTO = Time to detect + restore + validate.
- **Formula**:  
  `RTO = Time when Service Restored - Time when Outage Detected`

### SLA (Service Level Agreement)
- % of uptime guaranteed over a period (e.g., 99.9% per month).
- **Downtime Calculation**:
  - 99.9% ⇒ ≤ 43.8 min/month
  - 99.99% ⇒ ≤ 4.38 min/month
- **Formula**:  
  `SLA % = ((Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time) × 100`

### Example Table

| SLA %    | Max Downtime per Month |
|----------|------------------------|
| 99.0%    | 7.31 hours             |
| 99.9%    | 43.8 minutes           |
| 99.99%   | 4.38 minutes           |
| 99.999%  | 26 seconds             |

## Pro Tips

- Use **blue/green deployments** to reduce RTO.
- Employ **cross-region active-active DBs** for lower RPO.
- Track SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets using SRE principles.
