#### Intro
* [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/) is a Distributed Event Streaming solution that enables applications to efficiently manage billions of events
* Kafka was created by LinkedIn, which utilizes it to monitor activity data and operational analytics

#### Key Features
* **High Scalability**
	* Partitioned log model distributes data over several servers, allowing it to extend beyond the capabilities of a single server. 
	* Kafka has low latency and great throughput since it separates data streams
	* Can scale to 100s of brokers
	* Can scale to millions of messages per second
* **Fault-Tolerant & Durable**
	* By distributing partitions and replicating data over several servers, Kafka protects data from server failure and makes it fault-tolerant. 
	* It can restart the server by itself
* **Robust Integrations**
	* Kafka supports various third-party connectors. 
	* It also offers many APIs. Hence, you can add more features in a matter of seconds. 
	* Take a look at how you can use Kafka with Elasticsearch, Cassandra, and Snowflake
* **Comprehensive Analysis** 
	* For tracking operational data, Kafka is a popular solution. 
	* It enables you to collect data from several platforms in real-time and organize it into consolidated feeds while keeping a check with metrics
	* Refer to the Real-time Reporting with Kafka Analytics article for further information on how to analyze your data in Kafka
* **High performance**
	* Real time
	* Latency is less than 10ms

#### Use cases
* Messaging system
* Activity tracking
* Metrics 
* Logs
* streams processing
* microservices pub/sub

#### Cluster
* **Topics**
	* Its like table in database without contraint
	* Can have as many
	* Any kind of message format
	* The sequence of message called a data stream
	* Can not query this, instead use producer to send data bad consumer will read that
	* Are immutable, once data is written to partition it can not be changed
* **Partitions and offsets**
	* Topics are split in partitions
	* Messages within each partition are ordered
	* Each message withing partition gets an incremental id, called offset
	* Once data is written to a partition, it cannot be changed
	* Data is kept only for limited time (default 1 week)
	* Offset has meaning to certain partition only
	* Order is guaranteed only withing partition
	* Data is assigned randomly to a partition unless a key is provided
	* Can have as many partitions per topic
* **Topic replication factor**
	* Topic should have replication factor > 1 (2 to 3)
	* This way if a broker is down, another broker can still serve the data
	* e.g. Topic-A with 2 partitions and replication factor of 2
		* Broker 101 (Topic-A <Partition 0>)
		* Broker 102 (Topic-A <Partition 1>, Topic-A <Partition 0> {replication from Broker 101})
		* Broker 103 (Topic-A <Partition 1> {replication from Broker 102})	
* **Leader for a Partition**
	* At any time only one broker can be leader for a given partition
	* Producer can only send data to the broker that is leader of a partition, and other broker will replicate data
		* Broker 101 (Topic-A <Partition 0>) //Leader for Partition 0
		* Broker 102 (Topic-A <Partition 1>, Topic-A <Partition 0> {replication from Broker 101}) //Leader for Partition 
		* Broker 103 (Topic-A <Partition 1> {replication from Broker 102})	  
* **Topic durability**
	* Replication factor of 3 can withstand 2 broker loss
	* So for replication factor of N, you can bare lose to N-1 brokers and recover your data
* If you want to change datatype of your message then create new topic instead to avoid deserialision problem
	
#### Producers
* writes data to topics
* knows which partition to write to (and which kafka broker has it)
* Message Keys
	* Producer can choose to send a key with the message, 
	* If key is null data sent rount robin (partition 0,1,2, ..) else goes to same partition based on hashing (murmur2 algo > target parti = Math.Abs(Utils.murmur2(keyBytes)) % (numPartitions - 1) )
* Kafka only accepts bytes as input
* Can chose to receive acknowledgement of data writes
	* acks=0 > wont wait for acknowledgement (possible data loss)
	* acks=1 > will wait for leader acknowledgement (limited data loss)
	* acks=all > will wait for leader + all replica acknowledgement (no data loss)
	
#### Consumers
* Read data from topic
* Comsumers know which broker to read from
* If broker fails, consumer know how to recover
* data is read in order from low to high offset within each partition
* Ordering of messages only within partition
* Read bytes and deserialize it
* Consumer groups >  Each consumer from group will read from exclusive partitions
* Consumer offsets > 
	* Kafka stores the offsets at which a consumer group has been reading
	* The offset commited are in Kafka topic named __consumer_offsets
	* When consumer in group has processed data retreived from Kafka, it should be periodically committing the offset (broker will write to __consumer_offsets not group itself)
	  so if consumer dies it can able to read back from where it left off due to commited consumer offset
		  
#### Kafka Broker
* Cluser is composed of mutliple brokers (Servers)
* Each broker is identified with its ID 
* Each broker contain certain topic partitions
* After connecting to any broker (called bootstrap broker), you will be connected to the entire cluster
* Cluster can have from 3 to 100 brokers
* Data is distributed across brokers (called as horizontal scalling) e.g.  
	* Broker 101 (Topic-A <Partition 0>, Topic-B <Partition 1>)
	* Broker 102 (Topic-A <Partition 2>, Topic-B <Partition 0>)
	* Broker 103 (Topic-A <Partition 1>)
* Broker discovery
	* Every broker known as bootstrap broker
	* That mean you only need to connect one broker and client will know how to connect to the entire cluster
	* Each broker knows about all brokers, topics and partitions (metadata)

#### Zookeeper
* Manages brokers (keeps list of them)
* Helps in performing leader election in partition
* Sends notifications to Kafka in case of changes (new topic, broker dies, delete topics)
* Kafka 3.x can work without zookeeper (uses Raft instead) whereas Kafka 2.x can't work without zookeeper and Kafka 4.x will not have zookeeper
* By design, it operated with odd number of server (1, 3, 5, 7)
* Zookeeper has a leader (writes) and follower (reads)
* Use it if you use brokers
* Less secure than kafka
* Never use Zookeeper as a configuration in your Kafka clients
	
#### KRaft
* Zookeeper removed in 2020, due to scaling issues when cluster has > 100,000 partition
* Kafka 3.x now implements the Raft protocol in order to replace Zookeeper
